While many of Faulkner’s building descriptions are based on real locations in Mississippi, it is unknown if there is a direct inspiration for the Grierson home. 
                        The features are consistent with a Victorian-style architecture, yet the squarish frame is more consistent with the Greek Revival style of the 1860s.

                            Arsenic and other poisons had begun to be regulated in the later half of the 19th century.
                            33 states had adopted pharmacy laws modeled after Great Britain’s 1868 Pharmacy Act by 1890.
                            This law required Pharmacists to be licensed and to record transactions in which poisons, such as arsenic, were purchased.
                            Arsenic gained a great deal of attention following a series of poisoning murders in 1840s England.

                            Also known as a “toilet service”, a toilet set consists of items for shaving, bathing, and cosmetic upkeep.
                            During the 19th century, a toilet set plated in gold or silver was a status symbol reserved only for the very wealthy.
                            Affordable, portable, non-plated varieties gained popularity among the middle class in the late 19th century.
                            A toilet service was often a gift to a groom upon marriage.

                        <p class="italyp">
                            It is probable that the cousins still held distaste for northerners from the post-Civil War reconstruction period twenty years prior (1865 – 1877). Many southerners during that period saw the influx of northerners as trying to take advantage of their post-war disheveled economy. They labeled these northern opportunists as “carpetbaggers” as they would come to the south with all of their possessions in a carpet bag. A southerner, like Miss Emily, who welcomed the northerners and reconstruction would be called a “scalawag”, a term that held the connotation of being a traitor to the south. This may explain why Miss Emily’s relationship with Homer has scandalous connotations with the townsfolk.

                                Homer would have had to be dead for 50-365 days to enter the dry decomposition period for the smell to disperse naturally. Due to the humid climate of the south, it could be surmised that Homer’s body would take longer to dry. Prior to the dry period, a decomposing body undergoes putrefaction during which soft tissue is liquified and drained from the body. Therefore, it can be theorized that Miss Emily took action to rid the corpse and house of the smell, or that Homer was dead longer than previously thought.

                            China painting was a popular activity for women in the post-civil war area. Blank china plates were imported from France. A popular technique is to paint the porcelain by hand and fire it in a kiln. Repeating the painting and kiln-firing allows layered applications to become more vibrant.
                            <br /> Presumably, Homer Barron's corpse resides upstairs during these lessons.

                            Colonel Sartoris is first introduced in William Faulkner’s “Sartoris” (1929). It is the first of Faulkner’s published writing to take place in Yoknapatawpha County. Set after World War 1, it follows the decline of southern aristocracy and the Sartoris family. Colonel Sartoris’ character is based on William Faulkner’s great-grandfather who was a colonel in the confederate army.

                            The real mayor of Oxford, Mississippi at the time was likely Edward D. Beanland. Mayor Beanland only served for about 9 months from January 1919 to September 1919. He built the Beanland-Young house in 1905, which is notable for it’s deviation from the more traditional Victorian and neoclassical style of southern homes prior. The Beanland-Young house follows the “Prairie School” style of architecture, most famously represented in designs by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

It is from this building that a letter to Miss Emily could have been written and delivered from. It is also the building in which Miss Emily could have attended the Board of Aldermen meeting.
